  - an infared camera sensor
- In 2018, night vision goggles cost from $500 to $3K.
- The contraption shown here costed less than $100 dollars to build.

**Mediacenter**

- People like to use raspberry pis for media centers.
- Put simply, a media center turns your tv into a smart tv.
- But that's an oversimplification, mediacenters can do much more.
- Kodi is a popular media center software. Kodi can:

  - and a bunch of other neat stuff.

**Voice Assistant**

- Amazon is pretty open with their voice assistant service.
- Amazon echo can be loaded onto a raspberry pi.
- Hook up a speaker and a microphone, follow Amazon's setup instructions, and your pi becomes a fully featured smart speaker.

**Quadcopter**
