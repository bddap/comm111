A specific purpose statment is a personal goal, not necessarily communicated directly to the audience. A thesis statement is summary.

**4. Which type of attention getter appeals to you most? Why?**

Humor is usually my favorite. It's less work for an an audience to listen to a fun speech. An inheriently interesing topic may warrant a dry introduction.
