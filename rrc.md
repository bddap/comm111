# Chronological

Organized by time. Sections of the speech are sorted by when they occured, their instructional order, or some other temporal attribue. This is rare, but a speech might be organized in reverse time. A reverse time speech is potentially hard to understand but may be useful communicate a Problem-Cause senario.

# Spatial

As space is three dimentional, spatial organisation isn't used directly. Rather, topics are sorted by some scalar, e.g. how far they are from a specific location, where they are on a shelf, place along a coastline.

# Topical/Parts of the Whole

The proper order of a topicalcally organized speech is not always decided. Each main section of a Topical speech is ascosiated with an aspect, or subtopic of the speches primary topic.

# Cause/Effect

Perfect for finger pointing. A cause effect speech consists of an event/cause, followed by one or more results.

# Problem-Solution

Usually a either the problem, or the solution is ununciated. That is, the problem statement may be short, while the solution is what the speaker focuses on. Alternatively the solution may be minimal, and the problem gets the focus. A problem-SOLUTION speech is likely technical. A PROBLEM-solution speech likely seeks to incease awareness.

# Problem-Cause-Solution

A subclass of Problem-Solution, Problem-Cause-Solution provides an explanation of where the problem comes from. The solution in a Problem-Cause-Solution speech may relate directly to the previously mentioned cause.
