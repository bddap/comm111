<p><strong>Read Chapters 4 &amp; 8 in Exploring Public Speaking by Tucker and Barton. In 1⁄2 to 1 page, address the following:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. How does a specific purpose statement differ from a central idea (thesis) statement?</strong></p>
<p>A specific purpose statment is a personal goal, not necessarily communicated directly to the audience. A thesis statement is summary.</p>
<p><strong>2. Write a sample specific purpose statement for an informative speech.</strong></p>
<p>Comunicate some differences beweeen frogs and toads.</p>
<p><strong>3. Write a sample central idea/thesis statement for the same informative speech.</strong></p>
<p>Frogs and toads are distinct species.</p>
<p><strong>4. Which type of attention getter appeals to you most? Why?</strong></p>
<p>Humor is usually my favorite. It’s less work for an an audience to listen to a fun speech. An inheriently interesing topic may warrant a dry introduction.</p>
<p><strong>5. Which type of clincher appeals to you most? Why?</strong></p>
<p>Quotes work nicely. They are classy.</p>
