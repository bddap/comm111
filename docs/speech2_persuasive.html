<p>Andrew</br> Argue against your own opinions.</br> General Purpose: Persuade (Value)</br> Specific Purpose: Convince the audience to argue against their own opinions.</p>
<ol type="I">
<li>Attention
<ol type="A">
<li>Attention Getter: Confirmation bias.</li>
<li>Thesis Statement: If you want to find the truth, argue against your own opinions.</li>
<li>Preview: Let’s explore that a bit.<br />
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Need
<ol type="A">
<li>Describe the nature of the problem.:
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s easy not to change your mind.</li>
<li>If you are correct, that’s fine.</li>
<li>If you are incorrect, you’re stuck that way.</li>
<li>Everybody is wrong about things.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Give a relevant detailed example or examples.
<ol type="1">
<li>Imagine you walk to Whole Foods every day for your Topo Chico.</li>
<li>You take 10th street every day because it’s fastest.</li>
<li>9th street is less busy and has honeysuckle hanging over the sidewalk, you’re missing out.</li>
<li>Try the other metaphorical street.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Provide additional support (like statistics or testimony) that show the extent of the problem.
<ol type="1">
<li>In my estimation, 10/10 people are wrong about something. (Audience participation)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Show the relationship between the audience and the problem.<br />
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Satisfaction
<ol type="A">
<li>State the attitude, belief, or action you want the audience to adopt.
<ol type="1">
<li>If you care to be right, prove yourself wrong.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Explain your proposal; make it understandable.
<ol type="1">
<li>Check yourself so you can improve.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Show the logical connection between the need and its satisfaction.
<ol type="1">
<li>If you consider opposing opinions, you mitigate conformation bias.</li>
<li>Not only do you correct yourself when you are wrong.</li>
<li>By opposing your own <strong>true</strong> viewpoint, you learn exactly <strong>why</strong> it’s true.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Use facts, figures, and testimony to show that the proposal has worked effectively, or the belief has proved correct.
<ol type="1">
<li>The scientific method is, in a way, about discovering exactly how the scientist is wrong.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Show that your proposal can overcome any potential objections.
<ol type="1">
<li>Problem when convincing others
<ul>
<li>Arguing against your own opinion damages your stance when you don’t refute those contrary arguments.</li>
<li>Yes…</li>
<li>So if your goal is convince someone, don’t do this, it’s counterproductive.</li>
<li>Don’t shoot yourself in the foot during a persuasive speech.</li>
<li>Instead, when you talk in real life, or when you think to yourself, honestly explore how you could be wrong.<br />
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Alternative method, let others oppose your arguments.
<ul>
<li>Seems reasonable; if you take this route.</li>
<li>You’ll need friends who disagree with you.</li>
<li>You’ll need to <strong>actually listen</strong> to them.</li>
<li>Things to watch out for
<ul>
<li>Group think.</li>
<li>Irving Janis</li>
<li>Social pressures prevent critical/realistic thinking.</li>
<li>According to Nasa, groupthink is to blame for the fatal failure of the challenger mission.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Self doubt is uncomfortable and inneficient.
<ul>
<li>I aggree, if you always question yourself, how will you make desicions?</li>
<li>Only counter yourself once… or maybe twice for important things.</li>
<li>Reevaluate when you learn new information.</li>
<li>Thing to watch out for
<ul>
<li>Normalization of deviance.</li>
<li>Coined by Diane Vaughan</li>
<li>when you become used to something wrong, you gradually stop realizing it’s wrong</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Visualization (optional, only if time allows)
<ol type="A">
<li>Describe a positive future if your plan is put into action, OR:
<ol type="1">
<li>What if everybody tryed to prove temselves wrong?</li>
<li>What if nobody let thier minds be changed… Food for thought.</li>
<li>I will say this:
<ul>
<li>Changing your mind feels good.</li>
<li>The world starts to make a little more sense.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Have listeners imagine an unpleasant situation if they fail to put your plan into action.<br />
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Action
<ol type="A">
<li>Functions as your conclusion.</li>
<li>Restate the specific, overt action, attitude, or belief you are advocating (this is your call to action!).
<ol type="1">
<li>You all should try questioning even your most tightly held beleifs.</li>
<li>Maybe you’ll change your mind, maybe you’ll elucidate your own reasoning.</li>
<li>What’s the worst that could happen?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>State your personal intention to act.
<ol type="1">
<li>I’m going to consciously try opposing my own views.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>End with impact (clincher).
<ol type="1">
<li>Maybe it will help, probably not. Either way, I hope to gain some wisdom in the process.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
