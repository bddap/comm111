<p>I learned a more nuanced model for persuasion. Typically persuasion is viewed as an interaction between a Persuader, and a Persuadee.</p>
<pre><code>Old Model:
_____________                _____________
|           |                |           |
| Persuader | --arguments--&gt; | Persuadee |
|___________|                |___________|</code></pre>
<p>The new introduces sub actors within the Persaudee.</p>
<pre><code>New Model:                 _____________
_____________              | Persuadee |
|           |              |           |
| Persuader | --symbols----|--&gt; Pro    |
|___________|              |     ^     |
                           |     |     |
                           |     v     |
                           |    Con    |
                           |___________|</code></pre>
<p>The Persaudee runs an inner <strong>dialog</strong> relating to the argument. The actors in the dialog are Pro (Agreement) and Con (Disagreement). Realistically, more actors exist, but ignoring them is useful for simplicity.</p>
<p>The new model can explain common barriers to useful debate. Take a die hard dissident, for example. The book calls classifies them as “-3” on the Persuasion Continuum.</p>
<pre><code>Die Hard Dissident:        _____________
_____________              | Persuadee |
|           |              |           |
| Persuader | --symbols----|--&gt;        |
|___________|              |     ^     |
                           |     |     |
                           |           |
                           |    Con    |
                           |___________|
</code></pre>
<p>A “-3” has no “Pro” actor so arguments are dumped into a void.</p>
<p>Similarly, a “+3” has no “Con” actor, and therefore no inner <strong>dialog</strong>. Persuading a “+3” is ineffectual.</p>
<h3 id="name-at-least-three-objectives-youd-like-to-accomplish-in-your-persuasive-speech.">2. Name at least three objectives you’d like to accomplish in your persuasive speech.</h3>
<p>(NOTE: to persuade your audience of your proposition doesn’t count here. Think of improvements you’d like to make, concepts from Ch. 13 you’d like to experiment with, etc.)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make use of the new mental model.</li>
<li>Practice using a refutation section for fairness (not a two-tailed argument). Two tailed argument, in my experience, tend to be incomplete and biased.</li>
<li>Use both pathos and logos.</li>
</ol>

<p>Generalization, a form of inductive reasoning. It bears similarities to Analogical reasoning. Generalization differs from Analogical reasoning in that Generalization relies on repeated observations, and universally applicable abstractions.</p>
<h3 id="pick-five-logical-fallacies-from-chapter-14.-define-them-in-your-own-words.">4. Pick five logical fallacies from chapter 14. Define them in your own words.</h3>
<p>Analogical reasoning, when applied to non-similar subjects is a logical fallacy. Improper use of Analogical reasoning becomes <strong>false analogy</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>false cause</strong> is a cause-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.</p>
<p>When a false cause fallacy is used to predict something, its a <strong>slippery slope</strong> fallacy.</p>
<p><strong>Hasty generalization</strong> is an improperly used generalization, where the abstraction was created without sufficient evidence.</p>
<p>A <strong>straw man</strong> argument addresses and incomplete portion the opposing idea.</p>
