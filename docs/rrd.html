<li><p><strong>Which of the demographic characteristics listed in chapter two do you find most useful for speakers addressing this particular class? Why?</strong></p>
<p>It’s helpful to know education level. Education level is extra useful in this class because its already known in a two year college.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is it easier to research and deliver an informative speech on a broad or narrow topic? Why?</strong></p>
<p>A speech with a narrow topic is definitely less time consuming to research and deliver. Pick a topic too general and covering it exhuastively becomes more time consuming.</p></li>
