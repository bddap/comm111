<li><p><strong>What is audience analysis, and what is its purpose?</strong></p>
<p>The book defines audience analysis as an examination of demographic characteristics followed by internal psychographic trait examination, but the book’s definition may be to narrow.</p>
<p>Within the context of public speaking, audience analysis is an examination of the audience, possibly used to transform a speech. The speech may be edited before, or even during its execution.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Which of the demographic characteristics listed in chapter two do you find most useful for speakers addressing this particular class? Why?</strong></p>
<p>It’s helpful to know education level. Education level is extra useful in this class because its already known in a two year college.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Is it easier to research and deliver an informative speech on a broad or narrow topic? Why?</strong></p>
<p>A speech with a narrow topic is definitely less time consuming to research and deliver. Pick a topic too general and covering it exhuastively becomes more time consuming.</p></li>
