Argue against your own opinions.</br>
General Purpose: Persuade (Value)</br>
Specific Purpose: Convince the audience to argue against their own opinions.

  I.  Attention
	  A.  Attention Getter: Confirmation bias.
	  B.  Thesis Statement: If you want to find the truth, argue against your own opinions.
	  C.  Preview: Let's explore that a bit.  
 II.  Need
	  A.  Describe the nature of the problem.:
		  1. It's easy not to change your mind.
		  2. If you are correct, that's fine.
		  3. If you are incorrect, you're stuck that way.
		  4. Everybody is wrong about things.
	  B.  Give a relevant detailed example or examples.
		  1. Imagine you walk to Whole Foods every day for your Topo Chico.
		  2. You take 10th street every day because it's fastest.
		  3. 9th street is less busy and has honeysuckle hanging over the sidewalk, you're missing out.
		  4. Try the other metaphorical street.
	  C.  Provide additional support (like statistics or testimony) that show the extent of the problem.
		  1. In my estimation, 10/10 people are wrong about something. (Audience participation)
	  D.  Show the relationship between the audience and the problem.  
III.  Satisfaction
	  A.  State the attitude, belief, or action you want the audience to adopt.
		  1. If you care to be right, prove yourself wrong.
	  B.  Explain your proposal; make it understandable.
		  1. Check yourself so you can improve.
	  C.  Show the logical connection between the need and its satisfaction.
		  1. If you consider opposing opinions, you mitigate conformation bias.
		  2. Not only do you correct yourself when you are wrong.
		  3. By opposing your own **true** viewpoint, you learn exactly **why** it's true.
	  D.  Use facts, figures, and testimony to show that the proposal has worked effectively, or the belief has proved correct.
		  1. The scientific method is, in a way, about discovering exactly how the scientist is wrong.
	  F.  Show that your proposal can overcome any potential objections.
		  1. Problem when convincing others
			  - Arguing against your own opinion damages your stance when you don't refute those contrary arguments.
			  - Yes...
			  - So if your goal is convince someone, don't do this, it's counterproductive.
			  - Don't shoot yourself in the foot during a persuasive speech.
			  - Instead, when you talk in real life, or when you think to yourself, honestly explore how you could be wrong.  
		  2. Alternative method, let others oppose your arguments.
			  - Seems reasonable; if you take this route.
			  - You'll need friends who disagree with you.
			  - You'll need to **actually listen** to them.
			  - Things to watch out for
				  - Group think.
				  - Irving Janis
				  - Social pressures prevent critical/realistic thinking.
				  - According to Nasa, groupthink is to blame for the fatal failure of the challenger mission.
		  3. Self doubt is uncomfortable and inneficient.
			  - I aggree, if you always question yourself, how will you make desicions?
			  - Only counter yourself once... or maybe twice for important things.
			  - Reevaluate when you learn new information.
			  - Thing to watch out for
				  - Normalization of deviance.
				  - Coined by Diane Vaughan
				  - when you become used to something wrong, you gradually stop realizing it's wrong
 IV.  Visualization (optional, only if time allows)
	  A.  Describe a positive future if your plan is put into action, OR:
		  1. What if everybody tryed to prove temselves wrong?
		  2. What if nobody let thier minds be changed... Food for thought.
		  3. I will say this:
			  - Changing your mind feels good.
   			  - The world starts to make a little more sense.
	  B.  Have listeners imagine an unpleasant situation if they fail to put your plan into action.  
  V.  Action
	  A.  Functions as your conclusion.
	  B.  Restate the specific, overt action, attitude, or belief you are advocating (this is your call to action!).
		  1. You all should try questioning even your most tightly held beleifs.
		  2. Maybe you'll change your mind, maybe you'll elucidate your own reasoning.
		  3. What's the worst that could happen?
	  C.  State your personal intention to act.
		  1. I'm going to consciously try opposing my own views.
	  D.  End with impact (clincher).
		  1. Maybe it will help, probably not. Either way, I hope to gain some wisdom in the process.
