### 1. What did you learn from chapter 13?

I learned a more nuanced model for persuasion. Typically persuasion is viewed as an interaction between a Persuader, and a Persuadee.

```
Old Model:
_____________                _____________
|           |                |           |
| Persuader | --arguments--> | Persuadee |
|___________|                |___________|
```

The new introduces sub actors within the Persaudee.

```
New Model:                 _____________
_____________              | Persuadee |
|           |              |           |
| Persuader | --symbols----|--> Pro    |
|___________|              |     ^     |
                           |     |     |
                           |     v     |
                           |    Con    |
                           |___________|
```

The Persaudee runs an inner **dialog** relating to the argument. The actors in the dialog are Pro (Agreement) and Con (Disagreement). Realistically, more actors exist, but ignoring them is useful for simplicity.

The new model can explain common barriers to useful debate. Take a die hard dissident, for example. The book calls classifies them as "-3" on the Persuasion Continuum.

```
Die Hard Dissident:        _____________
_____________              | Persuadee |
|           |              |           |
| Persuader | --symbols----|-->        |
|___________|              |     ^     |
                           |     |     |
                           |           |
                           |    Con    |
                           |___________|

```

A "-3" has no "Pro" actor so arguments are dumped into a void.

Similarly, a "+3" has no "Con" actor, and therefore no inner **dialog**. Persuading a "+3" is ineffectual.


### 2. Name at least three objectives you’d like to accomplish in your persuasive speech.
   (NOTE: to persuade your audience of your proposition doesn’t count here. Think
   of improvements you’d like to make, concepts from Ch. 13 you’d like to experiment with, etc.)
   
1. Make use of the new mental model.
2. Practice using a refutation section for fairness (not a two-tailed argument).
   Two tailed argument, in my experience, tend to be incomplete and biased.
3. Use both pathos and logos.

### 3. What resonated with you from chapter 14, and why? (NOTE: do not write about logical fallacies here.)

Generalization, a form of inductive reasoning. It bears similarities to Analogical reasoning. Generalization
differs from Analogical reasoning in that Generalization relies on repeated observations, and
universally applicable abstractions.

### 4. Pick five logical fallacies from chapter 14. Define them in your own words.

Analogical reasoning, when applied to non-similar subjects is a logical fallacy. Improper use of Analogical reasoning becomes **false analogy**.

A **false cause** is a cause-effect relationship without sufficient evidence.

When a false cause fallacy is used to predict something, its a **slippery slope** fallacy.

**Hasty generalization** is an improperly used generalization, where the abstraction was created without sufficient evidence.

A **straw man** argument addresses and incomplete portion the opposing idea.
