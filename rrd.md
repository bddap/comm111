1. **What is audience analysis, and what is its purpose?**

	The book defines audience analysis as an examination of demographic characteristics followed by internal psychographic trait examination, but the book's definition may be to narrow.

	Within the context of public speaking, audience analysis is an examination of the audience, possibly used to transform a speech. The speech may be edited before, or even during its execution.

2. **Which of the demographic characteristics listed in chapter two do you find most useful for speakers addressing this particular class? Why?**

	It's helpful to know education level. Education level is extra useful in this class because its already known in a two year college.

3. **Is it easier to research and deliver an informative speech on a broad or narrow topic? Why?**

	A speech with a narrow topic is definitely less time consuming to research and deliver. Pick a topic too general and covering it exhuastively becomes more time consuming.
